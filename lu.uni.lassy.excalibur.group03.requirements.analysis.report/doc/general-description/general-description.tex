\label{chap:general_description}

All the information provided in this section is intended to present the system
for which the Messir analysis is provided. 

\section{Domain Stakeholders}
\label{sec:icrash-gendescr-stakeholders}

This section is intended to give a biref description of all the skateholders
which are present in the system. Their description is divided as follow, first a
brief description of the skateholder is given followed by the responsibilities
which each skateholder has. This information should help the skateholder to
achieve the skateholders objectives to a certain point. Each objective is
shortly explained and match to the corresponding use cases and their
corresponding views, which can be found on section .. of this document. All the

	•	to delete a virtual machine

	•	to have access to its profile and view all his personal informations

\subsection{SuperSysAdmin}

The superSysAdmin is a human person which is above the sysAdmin and is

the datacenter. Its objectives are:

	•	to request more ressources for the datacenter

	•	to get an overview of all the ressources which are currently beeing used

	•	to create a new sysAdmin, which includes defining the propper access rights
		of each individual sysAdmin

\subsection{Creator}

Any system needs to have a Creator skateholder which is a technician and is
responsible for installing the VMMS system on the targeted deployment
infrastructure. Its objectives are:

	•	to install the VMMS system

	•	to define the values for the initial system's state

	•	to define the values for the initial system's environment

	•	to ensure the integration of the VMMS system including its initial
