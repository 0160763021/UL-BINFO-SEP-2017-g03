\chapter{Software operations}
\label{chap:soptware_operations}


Explain each allowed software operations (i.e. an atomic unit of treatment, a service, a functionality) including a brief description of the operation, required parameters, optional parameters, default options, required steps to trigger the operation, assumptions upon request of the operation and expected results of executing such operation.
Describe how to recognise that the operation has successfully been executed or
abnormally terminated. The template given below (i.e. section \ref{operation:MyOperation} has to be used).

Group the operations devoted to the needs of specific actors. Common
operations to several actors may be grouped and presented once to avoid redundancy.


\section{createVMExpert}
\label{operation:createVMExpert}
This system operation allows a SysAdmin to create a virtual machine using expert
mode. Expert mode means that the SysAdmin can specify each component.

\begin{description}

\item \textbf{Parameters:} CPU, GPU, RAM, SSD, HDD, SOFTWARE
\item \textbf{Precondition:} Inorder to create a virtual machine the SysAdmin must
be logged in.
\item \textbf{Post-condition:} A new virtual machine will be created using
expert mode.
\item \textbf{Output messages:} The operation will send at the end one
notification telling the SysAdmin that he succefully created the desired virtual
machine.

\item \textbf{Triggering:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Click on one of the radio buttons to choose one component.
\item Click on the right black arrow to proceed to the new component.
\item Repeat the two above steps until you arrive at the finish page.
\item Click on the green arrow to create the desired virtual machine.
\end{enumerate}

 
\end{description}

 
\subsection{createVMExpertExample}
Examples should illustrate the use of \textbf{complex operations}.

Each example must show how the actor uses the software operation under
description to achieve (at least one of) its expected outcome.

It might be required to include GUI screenshots to illustrate the example.
