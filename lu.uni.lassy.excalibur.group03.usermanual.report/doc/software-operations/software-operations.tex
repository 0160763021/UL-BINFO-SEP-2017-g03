 \chapter{Software operations}
\label{chap:soptware_operations}


Explain each allowed software operations (i.e. an atomic unit of treatment, a service, a functionality) including a brief description of the operation, required parameters, optional parameters, default options, required steps to trigger the operation, assumptions upon request of the operation and expected results of executing such operation.
Describe how to recognise that the operation has successfully been executed or
abnormally terminated. The template given below (i.e. section \ref{operation:MyOperation} has to be used).

Group the operations devoted to the needs of specific actors. Common
operations to several actors may be grouped and presented once to avoid redundancy.

\section{CreateVMExpert}
\label{operation:CreateVMExpert}
This software operation creates a virtual machine by selecting your own
components
\begin{description}

\item \textbf{Parameters:} VMID, VMName, VMDescription, ComponentIDOne,
AmountOne, ComponentIDTwo, AmountTwo, ComponentIDThree, AmountThree,

created in case the sysadmin has correctly provided the necessary parameters
which means that the VID and all the CID must be already defined in the System
and the amount for the requested component just be less or equal to the
available quantity for that specific component. If this is the case the VM will
be created and a notification will be sent to the sysadmin else an error message
will be sent to the sysadmin.
\item \textbf{Output messages:} The operation will send at the end one
notification informing the sysadmin that he successfully created a virtual
machine or in case the name and/or description for the virtual machine is
missing then an error message will be sent to the sysadmin.
