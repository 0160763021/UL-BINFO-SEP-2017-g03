\section{\mysystemname}

VMMS is a simple web-oriented application aimed for individuals with the
objectiv to create and manage their own virtual machine. The application    
has two perspectives, one when logged in as SysAdmin and another when
logged in as an super-SysAdmin. As an super-SysAdmin you get the option to look
at the ressources utilization of the datacenter as well as the deployed virtual
machines by the SysAdmin's while SysAdmin has the option to create or modify 
a VM using his own preferences or by choosing a predined template.\\The benefits
for the client is to save on hardware without sacrificing on reliability and 
flexibility. At any point in time the SysAdmin can connect to the web-oriented
application where he gets access to all the created virtual machines and
personal account information about himself.\\For a super-SysAdmin using our
application means getting easy access and flexibility in terms of displaying and managing the deployed VMs.
